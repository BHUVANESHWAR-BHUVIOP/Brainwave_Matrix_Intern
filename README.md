# Data science/Data Analytics Internship at Brainwave_Matrix_Solutions

Welcome to my Data Science/Data Analytics Internship repository at Brainwave_Matrix_Solutions! This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in Data science/Data Analytics.

## Task 1:
Create a sale data analysis of any commercial

### Description:

The dataset contains transaction details from a retail store, including order and shipping dates, customer demographics, product categories, quantities sold, and sales amounts. It provides comprehensive information to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and shipping efficiency. The data can be used to explore trends, patterns, and correlations between different variables to make informed business decisions

For a detailed analysis and visualizations, please refer to the attached Jupyter Notebook file.

## Task 2:

### Description:

Analyze social media data (e.g., Twitter) to understand public sentiment towards specific topics, products, or events. Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data, extract sentiment scores, and visualize sentiment trends over time.
